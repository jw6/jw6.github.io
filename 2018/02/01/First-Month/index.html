<p>  I have the idea of starting my personal site a while ago, I thought about it again in January and I decided to make it work, and it’s finally up now, so I’m gonna wrote my first post here</p>
<p>  My coworker came across me the other day in lunch break, he talked to me about the idea of re-design a website for a small business of his friend. I have some time after work and I like his idea. The old site is still using flash, and it crashes sometimes, and it’s not mobile responsive and does not have many functionalities for customers to explore.</p>
<p>  The idea is simple, but his friend requested a lot of new fuctions to be added, things like, online shopping(of course), online chat, user can save some his/her favorites, and etcs. We used to develop a side-project after work, an eCommerce site using Spring MVC, AngularJS and OracleDB, we tweak some front-end side code, and I deployed it on Tomcat container(I made an EC2 instance), and showed it to his friend as demo. We talked a deal with his friend, we need to deliver this site in 4 - 6 months.</p>
<p>  Some questions came up to me when I was driving home after this day.</p>
<pre><code>-Architeture, how do we want this site to be, and future maintenance?
-Database! it&apos;s important, how do I manage a large amount(customer info, order info, receipts...)
-Deployment? AWS?
</code></pre><p>  I doubt about using Spring MVC + AngularJS + OracleDB is the solution in this situation, I really prefer something like Ruby on Rails, it’s probably the quickest way. But my coworker isn’t very familiar with it, MEAN might be a choice, and we also have some experience with Angular 4</p>
<p>  Database, is Oracle our answer though? I would prefer MongoDB as our database solution since this is a small business site. And if we do use MEAN as our choice, maybe we can think about some other choice for deployment like PaaS?</p>
